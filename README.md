# CAP5771 Apriori Algorithm Project
Academic Project for Principles of Datamining Course during the Fall 2023 semester

The goal for this project was to implement the Apriori algorithm to a dataset consisting of a list of transactions to generate the frequent item
sets for each transaction level, support count of each item set, and confidence rules.

The dataset was preprocessed using the Pandas library, and the Apriori algorithm was implemented with
dictionaries, lists, and tuples to extract the required data. 

The results were then written to a text file and
displayed in plots using the Matplotlib library.
